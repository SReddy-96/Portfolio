                Hello there, I'm Steven Reddy and my journey into the world of web development began in September 2023, when I made the bold move to live halfway across the world in South Korea. After a decade honing my skills in some of the finest restaurants in the UK as a chef, I decided to embark on a new path. <br />

                With a longstanding passion for coding and development, I've transitioned from the culinary world to pursue a full-time career in web development. Drawing from my experience as a chef, I bring a distinctive perspective to my coding endeavors, blending a passion for precision with a creative flair.<br />

                My focus lies primarily in crafting JavaScript web applications, where I pour my energy into both personal projects and self-directed learning. Embracing the dynamic nature of the field, I continually immerse myself in new languages and frameworks to stay ahead in this ever-evolving landscape.<br />

                Outside work, Iâ€™m obviously a massive foodie and I love to travel. I enjoy spending my spare time running and exploring the wilderness. <br />

                Join me on this exciting journey as I combine my culinary roots with my newfound passion for coding, shaping immersive digital experiences that captivate and inspire.<br />
